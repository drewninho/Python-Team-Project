App Authors: Fahed Alkhiami, Andrew Rabadi, Arianna Tarki

Description: This program will open a window that will prompt the user to enter their personal information, including
weight, height, exercise level, dietary restriction/preferences, and name. If the user already exists, then they can select
their preexisting profile. The program will use the given information to determine whether the user should gain, lose, or
maintain their current body weight. Will display a graphical representation of BMI placement, produce a suggested menu
of healthy foods, and generate a QR code for the user to save information to their phone for easier access.
